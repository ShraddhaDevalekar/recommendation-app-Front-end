     <p>The .card-group class is similar to .card-deck, which creates an <strong>equal height and width</strong> grid of cards.</p>
     <p>However, the .card-group class removes left and right margins between each card.</p>
     <p>In this example we have added extra content to the first card, to make it taller. Notice how the other cards follow.</p>
     <p><strong>Note:</strong> The cards are displayed vertically on small screens (less than 576px), <strong>WITH</strong> top and bottom margin:</p>
